Toby uses this image to discuss the requirements for Innovation:

## Innovation in Three Parts
 1) The Vision. A desired goal or "North Star" -- often the result of a creative flash of inspiration.
 2) The Strategy. Defined by specific choices, aligned to broader business goals (we want to use partner X or technology Y).
 3) The Journey. The discrete sequence of steps which lead to realizing the Vision.

 Above all, Innovation must be an *iterative* process. The path will not be clear until you've walked it.

*"Innovation cannot be merely the result of a lightning strike; it must be supported with discipline and adaptibility."*
