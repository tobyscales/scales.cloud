Toby is an Advisor in Google Cloud's Office of the CISO. 

In this capacity, he works with the largest and most innovative studios and production companies on the planet to ensure the security and integrity of their media supply chains.

Prior to joining Google in 2021, Toby worked at Microsoft where he spent five years bringing industry solutions to the Azure cloud. Some of the projects he worked on there include Avid's [Edit On-demand](https://www.avid.com/press-center/avid-redefines-video-editing-with-public-launch-of-avid--edit-on-demand-cloud-subscription-service/) and [Dreamworks's cloud-based animation pipeline](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/universal-microsoft-azure-cloud-production-1234743076/).

Before joining Microsoft: Toby built and sold a consulting agency in Seattle, oversaw the cloud and acquisition strategy for an MSP in New York, and worked as a Senior Architect at OmnicomMediaGroup.

In all his work, Toby is guided by a simple maxim: *build systems like you won't be there to support them; build relationships like you will*.
